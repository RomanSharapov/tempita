Status & License
================

Tempita is available under an `MIT-style license <license.html>`_.

It is actively developed, but not an ambitious project.  It does not
seek to take over the templating world, or adopt many new features.
I just wanted a small templating language for cases when ``%`` and
``string.Template`` weren't enough.
