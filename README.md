# Tempita

A small templating language for text substitution, originally authored by [Ian Bicking](https://bitbucket.org/ianb/).
It seems to me that [the original repository](https://bitbucket.org/ianb/tempita/src/default/) was abandoned by the author, so I'm picked it up to do some small fixes.

This isn’t meant to be the Next Big Thing in templating; it’s just a handy little templating language for when your project outgrows `string.Template` or `%` substitution. It’s small, it embeds Python in strings, and it doesn’t do much else.
